Now:


Next:
- path should include current standing/starting cell
- should not exit set destination when cannot reach destination cell
- clear red cells 


Later:
- patrol routes for agents
- random destinations for agents
- pause update loop on lose window focus
- install the popover2 lib from blueprint
- have tasks agents must complete (more anims ideally)


Awesome idea:
You are in an AI lab facility. The grid cells that make up the walkable terrain should be in a lab room, with robots that come out of side doors, and buttons that affect the current test.
Cool transition animations as the floor cells change for the next test.
